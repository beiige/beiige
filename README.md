#About me:

      I'm new to markdown, so bare with me. xd

Hello! I'm beiige, beige, or some sort of derivative of that. I'm a cybersecurity student. I like to try and learn new things in my free time. Video games are also pretty
neat. I play those too. Currently, I'm trying to get my feet wet in the world of pentesting and all it has to offer. I've always found exploiting vulnerabilities in 
software and hardware to be so cool. Making things do what they weren't intended to do; from game glitches to exploiting a flaw in firmware to execute unsigned code, I
think it's all pretty friggin' neat. If you'd like to get in touch with me for whatever reason, Discord would be the best place to do that. Just let me know you came from
Github if you decide to add me.
