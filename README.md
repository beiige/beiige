# About me:

Hello! I'm beige, beiige, beige-, Beige, and various other derivatives of beige. I'm a budding IT professional with a lot of passion for a lot of things. I like getting better at difficult things,
and you'll see that this reflects a lot in my choice of hobbies: learning foreign languages (currently ~N3 in Japanese, though I have not taken the JLPT), penetration testing, cooking, philosophy, and more.
I hope you enjoy your stay here on my GitHub page, where you'll find a whole lot of nothing at the moment. But with time, perhaps I'll develop something yet!
